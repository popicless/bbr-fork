This character will mostly be inspired by Captain Falcon and Mario while trying to bring its own twist on these characters through introducing even MORE inspiration by taking some notes from the [drunken fist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drunken_boxing) style of fighting.

Some fight scenes we'll be taking inspiration from is [Rock Lee's fight with Kimimaro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obsY9DF5ZDQ) and [Jackie Chan's "Epic Drunken Fighting"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74OBuMA2qEk).

Combo videos we'll be taking inspiration from is [SquidTheCat's "HIT PARADE"](https://youtu.be/-wDvStbEKAI?si=ZQP5zMJCYBQfjCIE) and [Sozin's "Pretty Melee"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9StrCFwi9s).

This shit is so cool I can't even contain my excitement

We'll still try to chuck in some flashy kill moves like Falcon's knee and Mario's f-air, so you'll still have your cool finishers!!!

Since you need to... well drink for this style to work, I think a sort of resource control system with drinking something would work.
