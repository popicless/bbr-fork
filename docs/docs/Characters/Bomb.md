Will mostly have Link's bomb jank.

Don't know how this will transfer to this physics engine in particular, but that's part of the fun!!!

Combo videos we'll be taking inspiration from is [Savestate's "Legacy"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tI7vDg_wxwY) and [whatever the fuck kind of wild shit RedXLink has going on](https://youtu.be/EEhZeEdgQls?si=U0au3f54I6spIkFW)

It'll be pretty difficult to transfer since the rest of Link's essential projectiles are being cut, so we'll have to improvise some stuff along the road.

Also since a lot of explosives characters in games are always like crazy people let's just make this guy sane and appropriately terrified of their own bombs lmaoaoaoao
