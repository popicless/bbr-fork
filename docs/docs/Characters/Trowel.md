its building time

only cool things i have in mind is building walls, being able to move them

and building flat platforms and standing on top of them while theyre moving to zoom

i dont know how to communicate this well so take my shitty visuals

wall tennis aint the only thing you can do tho

yeah so basically i just want more aggressive potential from the walls rather than whatever the fuck steve has going on in ultimate lmao
