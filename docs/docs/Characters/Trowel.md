its building time

only cool things i have in mind is building walls, being able to move them

and building flat platforms and standing on top of them while theyre moving to zoom

i dont know how to communicate this well so take my shitty visuals

wall tennis aint the only thing you can do tho

yeah so basically i just want more aggressive potential from the walls rather than whatever the fuck steve has going on in ultimate lmao

a good example of this is [Rumble VR](https://store.steampowered.com/app/890550/RUMBLE/), a [video from shoeless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xw8uGQAezm8) actually explains a lot of what we want for trowel and her offensive potential

the walls will be made fragile to encourage aggression and so that filthy fucking campers dont make goddamn forts
