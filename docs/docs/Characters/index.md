# Characters

These characters are basically just going to be **heavily** inspired by melee characters.

Each brickbattle weapon (including not having any weapon) is counted as its own character with its own unique moveset and set of interactions.

Here is a list of each character and their inspiration:

| Weapon | Character |
|--------|-----------|
| Sword | Marth |
| Bomb | Link |
| Slingshot | Shiek |
| Paintball Gun | Fox |
| Superball | Falco |
| Jet Boots | Yoshi |
| Rocket Launcher | Mostly Original (movement inspired by solider tf2 and ultrakill) |
| Trowel | Mostly Original |
| Fists | Mario or Captain Falcon |
