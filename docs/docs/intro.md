# What is this?

This is the design documentation for the game "Brickers!"

Since this is a fairly ambitious project, we do need to have a clear vision and roadmap for the game before we can proceed with creating it.

Fighting games are very complicated, and even if planning a lot of shit beforehand won't fix a lot of problems, it'll at least give a coherent roadmap for the game.

Things like gameplay details, tech stack, and concept art will be stored here.

This is an amateur project made by two people, so you can't exactly expect a masterpiece yet.

Have fun reading through!
