What do we mean by fluff?

We just mean the extra parts of a game like a currency system or a decoration system.

We do like ourselves some character customization, so we'll add a surface level customization system and not much outside of that really.

Adding fluff just kind of feels wrong for a game that kind of meant to be a really mature tech demo, so I'd rather keep it to a minimum.
