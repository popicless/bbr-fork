Instead of manually trying to add a deep and intricate tree of techniques, we're going to keep it simple and create a set of relatively surface level moves that synergize really well together.

Much of Melee's appeal is a lot of its accidental discoveries, and we want to try to replicate that the best we can (even if it's very hard) by keeping the same nature of having a large pool of surface level techniques that flow very well together.

The main idea should just be having a bunch of moves and making a tree of moves that are only one branch long. Having a large amount of two move combos should give a general idea of how to make combos if we wanted to go any deeper with them. Might also be a good way to gauge a character's potential!

This game will mostly follow the same control scheme as the smash series, so terms like f-air, n-air, f-tilt, f-smash still transfer. Only difference is that we're gonna be calling smash attacks strong attacks (which means f-smash will turn into f-strong) but I won't complain if you still use the previous term.

Anyways, here's what an example graph should look like for certain characters.

```
d-air -> f-air
d-air -> n-air

n-air -> grab
n-air -> d-tilt
```

Again, we're only going to limit the combos in this documentation to only two moves so that most of the advanced shit can be discovered emergently.
