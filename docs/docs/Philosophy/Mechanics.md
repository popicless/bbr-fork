Instead of manually trying to add a deep and intricate tree of techniques, we're going to keep it simple and create a set of relatively surface level moves that synergize really well together.

Much of Melee's appeal is a lot of its accidental discoveries, and we want to try to replicate that the best we can (even if it's very hard) by keeping the same nature of having a large pool of surface level techniques that flow very well together.
