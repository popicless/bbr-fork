# Character Design

too lazy to write, heres the plan:

1. create a personality for the character
2. that influences the animations
3. that influences everything else

after a rough draft of the movement, we will

1. create some moves that could chain into eachother (but only combos as long as two moves, yes two)
2. flesh out their movement options
